Introducing the Thread Library:

Welcome to our comprehensive Thread Library, specifically tailored for C programming on Windows systems.


 The following key functions are included:
 1. my_pthread_create: This function facilitates the creation of threads,  to spawn parallel execution units effortlessly.

2.my_pthread_join: Offering a seamless way to synchronize threads, this function ensures that the main thread waits for the specified thread to complete its execution

3.mythread_suspend and mythread_resume: These functions allow for the suspension and resumption of threads, respectively.

4.mythread_terminate: While the termination of threads is generally discouraged, this function provides a mechanism to forcefully terminate a thread if necessary, addressing exceptional scenarios.
